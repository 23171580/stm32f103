This is an effort to disassemble the serial bootloader
in the STM32F103.

The disassembly is done, but anotating it will be a work in
progress.  Keep an eye on boot.txt if you want to watch the
fun.  The rest of the files are some of the tools I use to
do the raw disassembly.

It is only about 800 lines of code.
